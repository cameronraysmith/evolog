  abstract	= {In a probabilistic cellular automaton in which all local
		  transitions have positive probability, the problem of
		  keeping a bit of information indefinitely is non- trivial,
		  even in an infinite automaton. Still, there is a solution
		  in 2 dimensions, and this solution can be used to construct
		  a simple 3-dimensional discrete-time universal
		  fault-tolerant cellular automaton. This technique does not
		  help much to solve the following problems: remembering a
		  bit of information in 1 dimen- sion; computing in
		  dimensions lower than 3; computing in any dimension with
		  non-synchronized transitions. Our more complex technique
		  organizes the cells in blocks that perform a reliable
		  simulation of a second (generalized) cellular automaton.
		  The cells of the latter automaton are also organized in
		  blocks, simulating even more reliably a third automaton,
		  etc. Since all this (a possibly infinite hierarchy) is
		  organized in ``software,'' it must be under repair all the
		  time from damage caused by errors. A large part of the
		  problem is essentially self- stabilization recovering from
		  a mess of arbitrary size and content. The present paper
		  constructs an asynchronous one-dimensional fault-tolerant
		  cellular automaton, with the further feature of
		  ``self-organization.'' The latter means that unless a large
		  amount of input information must be given, the initial
		  configura- tion can be chosen homogeneous.},

@Article{	  braakman2012,
  abstract	= {The fixation of into living matter sustains all life on
		  Earth, and embeds the biosphere within geochemistry. The
		  six known chemical pathways used by extant organisms for
		  this function are recognized to have overlaps, but their
		  evolution is incompletely understood. Here we reconstruct
		  the complete early evolutionary history of biological
		  carbon-fixation, relating all modern pathways to a single
		  ancestral form. We find that innovations in carbon-fixation
		  were the foundation for most major early divergences in the
		  tree of life. These findings are based on a novel method
		  that fully integrates metabolic and phylogenetic
		  constraints. Comparing gene-profiles across the metabolic
		  cores of deep-branching organisms and requiring that they
		  are capable of synthesizing all their biomass components
		  leads to the surprising conclusion that the most common
		  form for deep-branching autotrophic carbon-fixation
		  combines two disconnected sub-networks, each supplying
		  carbon to distinct biomass components. One of these is a
		  linear folate-based pathway of reduction previously only
		  recognized as a fixation route in the complete
		  Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, but which more generally may
		  exclude the final step of synthesizing acetyl-CoA. Using
		  metabolic constraints we then reconstruct a
		  “phylometabolic” tree with a high degree of parsimony
		  that traces the evolution of complete carbon-fixation
		  pathways, and has a clear structure down to the root. This
		  tree requires few instances of lateral gene transfer or
		  convergence, and instead suggests a simple evolutionary
		  dynamic in which all divergences have primary environmental
		  causes. Energy optimization and oxygen toxicity are the two
		  strongest forces of selection. The root of this tree
		  combines the reductive citric acid cycle and the
		  Wood-Ljungdahl pathway into a single connected network.
		  This linked network lacks the selective optimization of
		  modern fixation pathways but its redundancy leads to a more
		  robust topology, making it more plausible than any modern
		  pathway as a primitive universal ancestral form.},

@Article{	  braakman2012a,
  abstract	= {Metabolism is built on a foundation of organic chemistry,
		  and employs structures and interactions at many scales.
		  Despite these sources of complexity, metabolism also
		  displays striking and robust regularities in the forms of
		  modularity and hierarchy, which may be described compactly
		  in terms of relatively few principles of composition. These
		  regularities render metabolic architecture comprehensible
		  as a system, and also suggests the order in which layers of
		  that system came into existence. In addition metabolism
		  also serves as a foundational layer in other hierarchies,
		  up to at least the levels of cellular integration including
		  bioenergetics and molecular replication, and trophic
		  ecology. The recapitulation of patterns first seen in
		  metabolism, in these higher levels, motivates us to
		  interpret metabolism as a source of causation or constraint
		  on many forms of organization in the biosphere. Many of the
		  forms of modularity and hierarchy exhibited by metabolism
		  are readily interpreted as stages in the emergence of
		  catalytic control by living systems over organic chemistry,
		  sometimes recapitulating or incorporating geochemical
		  mechanisms.We identify as modules, either subsets of
		  chemicals and reactions, or subsets of functions, that are
		  re-used in many contexts with a conserved internal
		  structure. At the small molecule substrate level, module
		  boundaries are often associated with the most complex
		  reaction mechanisms, catalyzed by highly conserved enzymes.
		  Cofactors form a biosynthetically and functionally
		  distinctive control layer over the small-molecule
		  substrate. The most complex members among the cofactors are
		  often associated with the reactions at module boundaries in
		  the substrate networks, while simpler cofactors participate
		  in widely generalized reactions. The highly tuned chemical
		  structures of cofactors (sometimes exploiting distinctive
		  properties of the elements of the periodic table) thereby
		  act as 'keys' that incorporate classes of organic reactions
		  within biochemistry.Module boundaries provide the
		  interfaces where change is concentrated, when we catalogue
		  extant diversity of metabolic phenotypes. The same modules
		  that organize the compositional diversity of metabolism are
		  argued, with many explicit examples, to have governed
		  long-term evolution. Early evolution of core metabolism,
		  and especially of carbon-fixation, appears to have required
		  very few innovations, and to have used few rules of
		  composition of conserved modules, to produce adaptations to
		  simple chemical or energetic differences of environment
		  without diverse solutions and without historical
		  contingency. We demonstrate these features of metabolism at
		  each of several levels of hierarchy, beginning with the
		  small-molecule metabolic substrate and network
		  architecture, continuing with cofactors and key conserved
		  reactions, and culminating in the aggregation of multiple
		  diverse physical and biochemical processes in cells.},

@Article{	  letelier2006,
  abstract	= {This article analyses the work of Robert Rosen on an
		  interpretation of metabolic networks that he called (M,R)
		  systems. His main contribution was an attempt to prove that
		  metabolic closure (or metabolic circularity) could be
		  explained in purely formal terms, but his work remains very
		  obscure and we try to clarify his line of thought. In
		  particular, we clarify the algebraic formulation of (M,R)
		  systems in terms of mappings and sets of mappings, which is
		  grounded in the metaphor of metabolism as a mathematical
		  mapping. We define Rosen's central result as the
		  mathematical expression in which metabolism appears as a
		  mapping f that is the solution to a fixed-point functional
		  equation. Crucially, our analysis reveals the nature of the
		  mapping, and shows that to have a solution the set of
		  admissible functions representing a metabolism must be
		  drastically smaller than Rosen's own analysis suggested
		  that it needed to be. For the first time, we provide a
		  mathematical example of an (M,R) system with organizational
		  invariance, and we analyse a minimal (three-step)
		  autocatalytic set in the context of (M,R) systems. In
		  addition, by extending Rosen's construction, we show how
		  one might generate self-referential objects f with the
		  remarkable property f(f)=f, where f acts in turn as
		  function, argument and result. We conclude that Rosen's
		  insight, although not yet in an easily workable form,
		  represents a valuable tool for understanding metabolic
		  networks.},

@Book{		  britain1980,
  abstract	= {The chapter presents an exposition of why the
		  $\lambda$-calculus has models. The A-calculus was one of
		  the first areas of research of Professor Kleene, in which
		  the experience gained by him was surely beneficial in his
		  later development of the recursive function theory. The
		  chapter discusses a very short historical summary, and it
		  is found that there is considerable overlap with CURRY.
		  There is a review of the theory of functions and relations
		  as sets leading up to the important notion of a continuous
		  set mapping. The problem of the self-application of a
		  function to itself as an argument is discussed in the
		  chapter from a new angle. The model (essentially due to
		  PLOTKIN) of the basic laws of $\lambda$ -calculus thus
		  results. The chapter describes self-application to
		  recursion by the proof of David Park's theorem to the
		  effect that the least fixed-point operator and the
		  paradoxical combinator are the same in a wide class of
		  well-behaved models. The connection thus engendered to
		  recursion theory (r. e. sets) is outlined, and some remarks
		  on recent results about ill-behaved models and on induction
		  principles are discussed. The theme of type theory and a
		  construction of an ($\eta$)-model with fewer -type
		  distinctions is presented. There is a brief discussion of
		  how to introduce more type distinctions into models via
		  equivalence relations. The chapter also presents various
		  points of philosophical disagreement with Professor Curry.},

@Article{	  wagner2008b,
  abstract	= {Understanding the relationship between robustness and
		  evolvability is key to understand how living things can
		  withstand mutations, while producing ample variation that
		  leads to evolutionary innovations. Mutational robustness
		  and evolvability, a system's ability to produce heritable
		  variation, harbour a paradoxical tension. On one hand, high
		  robustness implies low production of heritable phenotypic
		  variation. On the other hand, both experimental and
		  computational analyses of neutral networks indicate that
		  robustness enhances evolvability. I here resolve this
		  tension using RNA genotypes and their secondary structure
		  phenotypes as a study system. To resolve the tension, one
		  must distinguish between robustness of a genotype and a
		  phenotype. I confirm that genotype (sequence) robustness
		  and evolvability share an antagonistic relationship. In
		  stark contrast, phenotype (structure) robustness promotes
		  structure evolvability. A consequence is that finite
		  populations of sequences with a robust phenotype can access
		  large amounts of phenotypic variation while spreading
		  through a neutral network. Population-level processes and
		  phenotypes rather than individual sequences are key to
		  understand the relationship between robustness and
		  evolvability. My observations may apply to other genetic
		  systems where many connected genotypes produce the same
		  phenotypes.},
